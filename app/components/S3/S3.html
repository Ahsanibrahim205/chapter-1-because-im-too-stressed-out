                            <h1>Coping <em>With Fear</em></h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>I know what to do, so why don’t I do it? Invariably, fear is a part of the answer. Whatever it is you know you ought to do or want to do is going to result in change. It may be a change in your appearance if weight loss is your goal. Or, perhaps, increased wealth if going for the promotion is your objective. Some people fear failure. Therefore, by not trying, you avoid the letdown. Others fear success. “I don’t deserve it” or “My friends will resent me.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Whatever your source of fear, it will prevent you from moving forward. That’s because the emotion of fear triggers inactivity. Better safe than sorry is a prevalent attitude that will keep you in that familiar rut, despite promising opportunities. At other times, you may be overwhelmed. No single problem alone is preventing you from moving forward. Instead, it’s all those little things, which keep piling up in your life. You become trapped in a vicious circle, unable to escape from a downward spiral. That’s when you need to clear the fog so that you can more clearly see the solution. Here are some things you can do which may help:</p>
<br>
                        <div class="text-content">
                              <div class="section-heading">
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Reduce your consumption of saturated fats</b>, including red meat and dairy products. The same deposits that can interfere with blood flow to the heart also can interfere with blood flow to the brain. Healthy arteries will help keep the brain in optimal working order.</li>
                            <li><b>Eat plenty of vegetables</b> because the flavonoids and carotenoids protect against vascular disease, stroke, and damage triggered by free radicals. All of these conditions have been associated with illnesses characterized by dementia – including Alzheimer's disease.</li>
                            <li><b>Feed your brain appropriate fuels</b>. Your brain depends upon all nutrients to function optimally, but it needs some things more than others. The B vitamin, choline, for example, is a precursor of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which contributes to your ability to consolidate information into memory. Eggs are an excellent source of choline, as are soy, wheat germ, peanuts, and brewer’s yeast.</li>
                            <li><b>Reduce your blood pressure</b>. Hypertension is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. Elevated blood pressure may result not only in hardening of the arteries, but also in strokes. There is a correlation between elevated blood pressure and a decline in memory and attention. Exercise is helpful in keeping blood pressure at healthy levels, as is a diet of reduced fat, cholesterol, and sodium. Calcium is beneficial to maintaining normal blood pressure; so try to keep plenty of leafy greens and fish in your diet. Meditation can also be helpful. Finally, treat the causes of snoring. If you sound like a wounded animal at night, it may be due to restricted airways. Treat the allergy or structural flaw; otherwise, the reduced oxygen intake can lead to high blood pressure and other vascular problems. You’ll also awaken feeling tired, due to reduced oxygen intake during the night. Your brain’s memory center and your heart will thank you for doing these things.</li>
                            <li><b>Take steps to ward off depression</b>. Conventional wisdom says that a decline in cognition results in depression. The opposite is probably true: depression causes cognitive decline. If you feel depression coming on, increase your B vitamins, especially B12. Eating foods rich in carbohydrates, with a small amount of protein, may trigger a rise in serotonin, which has been found to alleviate depression symptoms in some people. You should also seek medical advice to determine if you might need a pharmacologic intervention to treat a chemical imbalance.</li>
                            <li><b>Use your brain</b>. Don’t let it atrophy like an unused muscle. Keep it stimulated, and the functional connections between neurons will remain optimal. This can be especially helpful during aging. Continue to read; take an interest in current events; and share ideas with others. These activities are your intellectual treadmill for optimal cognition. And while I’m on the subject of the brain, let’s take a few lessons from this ultimate ‘change’ machine. Whether you want to change or whether you want to motivate others to change, there are some simple lessons to be learned from the human mind. Here’s what we know and what we can do:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The brain is conservative and prefers the familiar. Connect the novel part of a new initiative to something familiar. Reframe so the new approach becomes a natural progression, rather than an abrupt change.</li>
                                    <li>The brain is curious and, therefore, wired to collect and to process information. Gather as much relevant information as you can. Delve into the scientific explanation, which justifies the change you are about to make. Fear is the emotion of the future. It arises when you don’t know what’s going to happen next. Therefore, the more you know, the less you fear.</li>
                                    <li>In the wake of fear, the brain attempts to conserve energy, which is needed to fuel creativity. Take steps to reduce stress and the related emotions, such as fear, anger, and sadness. They will sap the energy you need to succeed. Stress also will trigger the fight/flight behaviors, which are designed to conserve energy for your survival, not your growth.</li>
                                    <li>The brain responds to images. You don’t respond to the world. Instead, you respond to a visual or auditory image of the world. While you may not be able to change events, you can influence your perception of them. Examine your beliefs, which shape your images. Where did they come f</li>
                                    <li>The brain seeks meaning. Whatever path you choose, make sure it gets you closer to your personal and/or professional goals. In this way, there will be a common thread linking all that you do to both the past and to the future. Your steps will become a logical progression from the familiar past as you make progress towards a healthier future.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                        </ul>         
                        <p>Remember to take care of your brain. The payoff will be in multiple forms and for the rest of your life.</p>
